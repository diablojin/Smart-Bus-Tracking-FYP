# Icons Folder

This folder contains icon assets for the Smart Bus Tracking System app.

## Usage

Place your icon files here (PNG, SVG, etc.) and reference them in your Flutter code using:

```dart
Image.asset('assets/icons/your_icon_name.png')
```

## Common Icons to Add

- Bus icons for different states (active, inactive, delayed, etc.)
- Map markers (custom bus stops, origin, destination)
- Navigation icons
- Status indicators
- UI elements

Remember to declare assets in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/
```
